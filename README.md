## Running the Models/Viewing the Results
-for OGWiC subtask:
-run the **median_disagreement_XLM.ipynb** for **XLM Model**
-run the **median_disagreement_adapter** for **XLM + Adapter Model**
-run the **median_disagreement_ensemble** for **XLM + Ensemble Model**

-for DisWiC subtask:
-run the **mean_disagreement_XLM.ipynb** for **XLM Model**
-run the **mean_disagreement_adapter** for **XLM + Adapter Model**
-run the **mean_disagreement_ensemble** for **XLM + Ensemble Model**

## Notebooks

- **median_analysis.ipynb** provides code to analyse the OGWiC dataset
- **mean_analysis.ipynb** provides code to analyse the DisWiC dataset

## Datasets

-all datasets are publicly available at https://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/data/wugs
